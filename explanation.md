<h1>Encapsulation in Object Oriented Programming</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Encapsulation allows an object to separate its interface from its implementation. The data and the implementation code for the object are hidden behind its interface.</p>
<p>Encapsulation hides internal implementation details from users.</p>
<h3><em>Example:</em></h3>
<p><em>A Customer may issue a check and now know how it is processed. <br>The internal processing is hidden from the customer. Similary, the <br>inessential attributes of a class are hidden from users by using encapsulation. The <br>hidden attributes of a class are called protected attributes.</em></p>





<h3>What use Getters and Setters</h3>
<p>We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.</p>
